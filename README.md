# AD ACF Blocks

Add some custom blocks for the new WordPress Editor.

## Description

AD ACF Blocks is a collection of custom blocks for the new editor. They're all made with ACF.

### Installation

* Download the zip archive and upload it to your WordPress site. 
* Activate the plugin, ACF must be activated. 
* Start using the blocks in any post or page!

### CSS Customisation

These blocks are quite raw, design speaking. You’ll wish to add some CSS in your theme.\ 
Please inspect the source code and look for the classes you’d like to style.

Here are some useful classes to define:

* .acf-block--_blockname_: general class for all blocks.
* .acf-block-container__.center-max__: use here a max-width to keep the block content centerd on screen.


## To-Do
