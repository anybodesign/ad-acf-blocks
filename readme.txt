Add some custom blocks for the new WordPress Editor.


== Description ==

AD ACF Blocks is a boilerplate of custom blocks for the new editor. They're all made with ACF.


= How-To =

== CSS Customisation ==

These blocks are quite raw so you'll wish to add some CSS in your theme.\ 
Please inspect the source code and look for the classes you'd like to style.

Here are some useful classes to define:

* `[class*=".acf-block--"]`: general rules for all blocks.
* `.acf-block-container.center-max`: **center-max** is used to define a max-width in order to keep the block's content centered on screen.


== To-Do ==

Create more blocks, and look for a way to override some block templates


== Installation ==

* Download the zip archive and upload it to your WordPress site. 
* Activate the plugin, ACF Pro (at least version 5.8) must be activated as well. 
* Start using the blocks in any post or page!


== Screenshots ==

1. Block List
2. Admin View
3. Front-End View
